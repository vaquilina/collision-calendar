# Collision Calendar

**ðŸš§ IN DEVELOPMENT ðŸš§**

A FOSS, self-hosted, web-based tool for scheduling shared spaces.

This was created to solve two problems:

1. The challenge of scheduling the use of shared, divided spaces, where divisions cannot always be occupied
   simultaneously
2. The process of finding blocks of time that are most agreeable to a group of people
