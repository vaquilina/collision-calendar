# Collision Calendar

**ðŸš§ IN DEVELOPMENT ðŸš§**

A FOSS web-based tool for scheduling shared spaces.

This was created to solve two problems:

1. Scheduling the use of shared spaces with divisions, where divisions cannot
   always be occupied simultaneously
2. Easing the process of finding blocks of time that are agreeable to a group of
   people
